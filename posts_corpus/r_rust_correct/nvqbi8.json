    "selftext": "[Link](https://github.com/julihoh/pdf_annotation_fix)\n\nFrom the README:\n\n>macOS Preview sometimes 'forgets' about annotations that were added to a PDF file. This can be particularly frustrating after providing feedback on a draft for many hours, just to loose the precious annotations when closing and re-opening the file.  \n>  \n>This tool attempts to fix the annotations based on [a technique described by 'thorimur'](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251532057?answerId=251532057021#251532057021).\n\nI wrote this little tool in Rust this morning and am just super stocked at how Rust let's me write a tool like this in a couple an hour or two <3.\n\nHere are the reasons why I like it so much:\n\n* I considered doing it in python, but decided against it due to the subpar dependency management, as I would have needed to add a PDF library. With Rust, this was no issue.\n* Thanks to strong/explicit typing, I barely had to look at the documentation of the PDF library.\n* With anyhow and its handy context extension I am confident that if an error should crop up in usage, I would have a starting point to look into the code just from the error message alone.\n* With structopt, adding some nice command line options was a breeze and literally came down to copying the example code and adjusting a bit of text.\n\nThanks to the whole community for making little things like this such a pleasure :) Cheers!"
