    "selftext": "Tantivy  v0.15 released!  Now backed by Quickwit Inc.!\n\nTantivy is a search engine library. It is similar in many ways \nto Apache Lucene, but for rust.\n\nWe haven't communicated much about it, but I (fulmicoton) \nrecently co-founded [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io) to \ncreate a cost-efficient search engine.\n\nThis is great news for tantivy, as it will receive more love\nand time.\n\nAs a result, the CHANGELOG is especially impressive for this \nrelease.\n\nIf you have a search use case for tantivy, please reach out to me\n(paul@quickwit.io). \nEspecially if you have a use case to search terabytes or petabytes of data,\nI'd love to help you slash your bill with [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io).\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n# Changelog\n \n- API Changes. Using Range instead of (start, end) in the API and internals (FileSlice, OwnedBytes, Snippets, ...) This change is breaking but migration is trivial. (@fulmicoton)\n- Added an Histogram collector. (@fulmicoton) #994\n- Added support for Option. (@fulmicoton)\n- Bugfix consistent tie break handling in facet's topk (@hardikpnsp) #357\n- Date field support for range queries (@rihardsk) #516\n Added lz4-flex as the default compression scheme in tantivy (@PSeitz) #1009\n- Renamed a lot of symbols to avoid all uppercasing on acronyms, as per new clippy recommendation. For instance, RAMDirectory -> RamDirectory. (@fulmicoton)\n- Simplified positions index format (@fulmicoton) #1022\n- Moved bitpacking to bitpacker subcrate and add BlockedBitpacker, which bitpacks blocks of 128 elements (@PSeitz) #1030\n- Added support for more-like-this query in tantivy (@evanxg852000) #1011\n- Added support for sorting an index, e.g presorting documents in an index by a timestamp field. This can heavily improve performance for certain scenarios, by utilizing the sorted data (Top-n optimizations)(@PSeitz). #1026\n- Add iterator over documents in doc store (@PSeitz). #1044\n- Fix log merge policy (@PSeitz). #1043\n- Add detection to avoid small doc store blocks on merge (@PSeitz). #1054\n- Make doc store compression dynamic (@PSeitz). #1060\n- Switch to json for footer version handling (@PSeitz). #1060\n- Updated TermMerger implementation to rely on the union feature of the FST (@scampi) #469\n- Add boolean marking whether position is required in the query_terms API call (@fulmicoton). #1070\n- DocAddress is now a struct (@scampi) #987"
