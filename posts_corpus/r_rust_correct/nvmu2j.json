    "selftext": "I noticed Rocket 0.5 is coming pretty dang soon there is just one issue left - https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/1329. Documentation! Figure since people ask about it all the time it might be worth trying to recruit some people to help document async Rocket to speed up the release. I am in no way affiliated with the project and just want to socialize the upcoming release and an easy way to help a great project cross the finish line to stable rust!"
