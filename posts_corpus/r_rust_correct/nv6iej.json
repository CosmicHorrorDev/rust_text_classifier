    "selftext": "I'd like to announce [version 0.3.0 of the duplicate crate](https://crates.io/crates/duplicate).\n\nAbout: `duplicate` provides macros that allow you to avoid repetition.  Instead of copy-pasting some Rust code and then editing a few places, `duplicate` can make copies for you and insert different code in the key places for every copy. [See the documentation for more details.](https://docs.rs/duplicate)\n\nIn addition to some bug fixes, this update includes two major changes:\n\nThe big one is the introduction of *Global Substitutions*. These substitutions work identically across duplicates and don't themselves trigger additional duplicates. This can be used to avoid repetition across duplicates or even when no duplicates are needed. Do you have a huge \\`where\\` clause that you need to repeat everywhere? Ask you local cargo to prescribe you \\`duplicate\\` 0.3.0. See the [new section in the documentation](https://docs.rs/duplicate/0.3.0/duplicate/#global-substitutions) for more details.\n\nAdditionally, this update  locks down which bracket types can be used at different places in the syntax. While this is technically a breaking change (which is why we incremented the minor version), users who only used brackets similarly to how the documentation did won't need to update their code. I surveyed projects using \\`duplicate\\` on Github and I found none that would require code updates.\n\nGot a question or feature request? Feel free to either drop a comment or \\[open an issue\\]([https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/new/choose))."
