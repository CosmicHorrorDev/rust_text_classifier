    "selftext": "I'm using the rust-analyzer VSCode extension (just by itself), but it seems to have just stopped working altogether; I can't get any information when hovering over anything, no intellisense, error detection, and even semantic highlighting won't work.\n\n`clean`, `check`, `build`, and `test` are all working perfectly fine (run from the VSCode terminal), it's just the extension that isn't working.\n\nI've checked for updates for VSCode (am on Xubuntu), and there don't seem to be any, and I tried to check the version for rust-analyzer as described here (https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#troubleshooting), but while I do get 6 commands for rust analyzer in VSCode (\"Copy Run Command Line\", \"Debug ItemTree\", \"Move item down/up\", \"Peek related tests\", \"View Crate Graph\"), I don't have one for checking the version, and running `rust-analyzer --version` tells me the command `rust-analyzer` was not found, and that I can install it with `sudo snap install rustup`.\n\nBut I already have rustup, installed via `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh`, and also if I didn't have rust I wouldn't be able to run all the cargo commands anyway.\n\nI also tried disabling and re-enabling the extension, as well as uninstalling it, and restarting VSCode and the computer, as well as `rustup update`, but nothing is fixing it.\n\nWhat's the problem here?"
