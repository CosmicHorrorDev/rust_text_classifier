We are flexible on what testing framework is used.\n\nRust tests are easy enough and testing of anything which is `extern \"C++\"` is just an extension of the Rust test framework, but specifically I am trying to figure out how to write C++ tests for C++ code and possibly for `extern \"Rust\"` integrations in C++ land."
