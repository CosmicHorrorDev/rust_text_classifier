I'm trying to wrap my head around Rust enums, which seem much closer to algebraic data types from Haskell than enums from Java.\n\nI'm struggling to model a situation where I'd normally use a Java enum to map my code model to a set of constants. Just for a really terrible example, if I wanted to map baseball statistics to their short form name, I'd write up something like this:\n\n    public enum Statistic {\n      BATTING_AVERAGE(\"BA\"),\n      ON_BASE_PERCENTAGE(\"OBP\"),\n      ...\n      ;\n\n      public final String shortName;\n\n      Statistic(String shortName) {\n        this.shortName = shortName;\n      }\n\n      public static Optional<Statistic> fromString(String maybeStatistic) {\n        return Stream.of(Statistic.values())\n          .filter(stat -> stat.shortName.equalsIgnoreCase(maybeStatistic))\n          .findFirst();\n      }\n    }\n\nIt's pretty concise and I never have to repeat the `BA` string anywhere: it's always associated with that enum entry.\n\nWhat's the best way to model this in Rust? My attempt is pretty ugly and I think I'm doing something wrong because it gives me none of the enum<=>string relationship that is guaranteed from my Java enum:\n\n    enum Statistic {\n        BattingAverage,\n        ...\n    }\n\n    impl Statistic {\n        fn short_name(&self) -> String {\n            match self {\n                Statistic::BattingAverage => String::from(\"BA\"),\n                ...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    impl FromStr for Statistic {\n        type Err = String;\n\n        fn from_str(stat: &str) -> Result<Statistic, Self::Err> {\n            match stat.to_uppercase().as_str() {\n                \"BA\" => Ok(Statistic::BattingAverage),\n                ...\n                _ => Err(format!(\"Unrecognized statistic {}\", stat)),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nAm I just thinking about this wrong? Is there a better way?"
