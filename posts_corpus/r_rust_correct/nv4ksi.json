    "selftext": "Analyse the structure of any self-describing data format with one line of code:\n\n    let inferred: InferredSchema = serde_json::from_slice(data)?;\n\nHow does this work? By calling [deserialize\\_any](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/trait.Deserializer.html#tymethod.deserialize_any) on the Deserializer then having the Visitor return an enum variant corresponding to the type of value found. A more in-depth run through is in the [analysis module docs](https://docs.rs/schema_analysis/latest/schema_analysis/analysis/) of the crate, but be warned of excessive anthropomorphization.\n\nSince this is something that is handy to have around for a quick run, I also put it on a [website](https://schema-analysis.com/).\n\nThanks to Serde for the amazing platform and all the hard work from the community to implement the formats! And thanks [Schemars](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/) and [json\\_typegen](https://docs.rs/json_typegen/latest/json_typegen/) which make the website more useful.\n\n\\[[crate](https://crates.io/crates/schema_analysis)\\]\\[[docs](https://docs.rs/schema_analysis/latest/schema_analysis/)\\]\\[[repo](https://github.com/QuartzLibrary/schema_analysis)\\]\n\nP.S.: As this is my first contribution, constructive criticism is welcome!"
