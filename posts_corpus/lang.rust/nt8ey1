Traits bound for struct, tuples or enums
I was wondering, is there some traits for types like Tuple or Struct, like there is for Closures (Fn) ? To be able to "attach" some methods on all Tuples or Structs or Enums.

As example

    trait AutoNew {
        fn new() -> Self;
    }
    impl<T: FieldStruct> AutoNew for T {
        fn new() -> Self {
            T {}  // That part only works for Field struct types
        }
    }
