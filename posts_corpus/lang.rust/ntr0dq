Stopping and later resuming a partial download with Rust
I'm making an application that has asynchronous downloading of multiple files, but I am looking at what happens if the application is turned off while files are downloading.  

It appears that the downloads have to start over from scratch.  So far I'm not able to find any information on how to stop a download midway and resume that download later in Rust.  Anyone have any ideas for where to start on this?
