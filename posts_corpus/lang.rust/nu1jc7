Tantivy  v0.15 released!  Now backed by Quickwit Inc.!

Tantivy is a search engine library. It is similar in many ways 
to Apache Lucene, but for rust.

We haven't communicated much about it, but I (fulmicoton) 
recently co-founded [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io) to 
create a cost-efficient search engine.

This is great news for tantivy, as it will receive more love
and time.

As a result, the CHANGELOG is especially impressive for this 
release.

If you have a search use case for tantivy, please reach out to me
(paul@quickwit.io). 
Especially if you have a use case to search terabytes or petabytes of data,
I'd love to help you slash your bill with [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io).

# Changelog
 
- API Changes. Using Range instead of (start, end) in the API and internals (FileSlice, OwnedBytes, Snippets, ...) This change is breaking but migration is trivial. (@fulmicoton)
- Added an Histogram collector. (@fulmicoton) #994
- Added support for Option. (@fulmicoton)
- Bugfix consistent tie break handling in facet's topk (@hardikpnsp) #357
- Date field support for range queries (@rihardsk) #516
 Added lz4-flex as the default compression scheme in tantivy (@PSeitz) #1009
- Renamed a lot of symbols to avoid all uppercasing on acronyms, as per new clippy recommendation. For instance, RAMDirectory -> RamDirectory. (@fulmicoton)
- Simplified positions index format (@fulmicoton) #1022
