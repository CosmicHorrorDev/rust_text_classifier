How to convert prost::Message to Vec<u8>?
I'm brand new to rust and struggling to do something simple. I have protobuf messages I'm attempting to convert to `Vec<u8>` to store as values in etcd.

Looking at the Prost build output, the structs derive `prost::Message`:

`#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, ::prost::Message)]pub struct Entity {...}`

From the docs, it appears I should use the encode method, but I'm receiving errors attempting to use any of the `prost::Message` methods on my Entity struct.

I'm trying the following approach, but I receive "no method named \`encoded\_length\` found for struct \`Entity\`.

`let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(entity.encoded_length());`

`entity.encode(&mut buf)`

Am I missing something here?
