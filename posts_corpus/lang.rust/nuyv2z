what does mean some syntaxes
i have just start learning rust with this 2 books [book 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-02-example-structs.html) & [book rtlk](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) and i stuck on two syntaxes i really don't understand :


     struct VecStorage<T>(Vec<MaybeUninit<T>>)
I don't find any explanation about this kind of struct declaration (this come from the [specs](https://docs.rs/specs/0.17.0/src/specs/storage/storages.rs.html#262-266) library).



    gs.ecs.register::<Position>();
this line come from the [rltk-book](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_2.html) the double two points seems to mean it's a 'static' stuff, but what the hell does mean <type>() ?
I don't find any explanation on this syntax either. ('register' definition can be find in [specs](https://docs.rs/specs/0.17.0/specs/trait.WorldExt.html#tymethod.register) library too)


It would be very nice if someone could explain to me.
