Is there a rust equivalent to ArchUnit?
Hello,

In order to maintain large code bases with many contributors, architecture tests help to enforce a certain type of architecture and prevent nasty cyclic dependencies.

In Java and C# there is ArchUnit, which does this job more or less perfectly.

I was wondering if there is an equivalent int rust?
