What are the most "professional" crates?
By this I mean the crates that are most likely to be used by professional Rust users (i.e. using it in their job) and least likely to be used by hobbyists.

I figured a good way to measure this was to look at crates.io downloads across weeks - if most downloads of a crate happens during workdays and not a lot of downloads during weekends, then intuitively that crate is used in a professional setting rather than by hobbyists.

As an example, check out the [download graph of bevy](https://crates.io/crates/bevy) versus the [download graph of dockerfile](https://crates.io/crates/dockerfile). For bevy, the downloads are spread pretty much evenly. Meanwhile, dockerfile gets practically no downloads during weekends but a lot of downloads on workdays.

I considered two metrics:

- Proportion of workday downloads as part of total downloads (i.e. a crate that is downloaded exclusively on workdays has a score of 1, and one that is downloaded exclusively on weekends has a score of 0).

- Pearson correlation of a dataset `(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)` where y_i = number of downloads on a certain day and x_i = 0 if that day is a weekend or 1 if it is a workday. In this way, the correlation is close to 1 if there are more downloads on workdays than weekends.

I don't really know if these are a proper way of measuring, but I took these two metrics (for any crate with more than 100,000 total downloads) and multiplied them together. This gives the following list of the top 20 most "professional" crates  (with their "professionality" scores):

    checked_int_cast               0.818
    match_cfg                      0.779
    graphql-introspection-query    0.765
    cached_proc_macro_types        0.764
    atomic-shim                    0.757
    log-mdc                        0.755
    tinyvec_macros                 0.753
    pdqselect                      0.733
    treeline                       0.719
    base58                         0.707
    haversine                      0.687
    asynchronous-codec             0.683
    parity-util-mem-derive         0.681
    dyn-clonable                   0.675
    dyn-clonable-impl              0.675
    strip-ansi-escapes             0.667
    parity-send-wrapper            0.666
    mio-more                       0.665
    tokio-named-pipes              0.664
    console-web                    0.661

Indeed, if you check `checked_int_cast` it appears to be downloaded primarily on workdays.

Here's the top 20 for just the first metrics (proportion of workday downloads)

    haversine                      0.989
    flatdata                       0.989
    quest                          0.982
    dockerfile                     0.979
    broadcast                      0.977
    env                            0.976
    sentry-failure                 0.976
    duct_sh                        0.974
    console-web                    0.973
    sentry-log                     0.973
    libtest-mimic                  0.973
    port_scanner                   0.973
    serde_millis                   0.972
    zbus_polkit                    0.971
    indent_write                   0.970
    nom-supreme                    0.969
    lazy_format                    0.969
    priority-queue                 0.969
    mobc                           0.969
    function_name                  0.968

And just the second metric (pearson correlation):

    match_cfg                      0.890
    tinyvec_macros                 0.888
    checked_int_cast               0.876
    log-mdc                        0.862
    graphql-introspection-query    0.848
    atomic-shim                    0.848
    pdqselect                      0.847
    treeline                       0.843
    cached_proc_macro_types        0.825
    base58                         0.819
    parity-util-mem-derive         0.791
    dyn-clonable                   0.789
    dyn-clonable-impl              0.788
    strip-ansi-escapes             0.779
    tokio-named-pipes              0.779
    parity-send-wrapper            0.773
    asynchronous-codec             0.770
    tokio-service                  0.768
    hyper-old-types                0.708
    supercow                       0.699

Not really sure which metric is best of those 3 above, but hopefully this paints a somewhat complete picture.

Now, it shouldn't be surprising that a lot of these crates are... "boring". Unlike hobbyist crates like bevy, they're not used because people find them fun or exciting. These crates are used for a specific purpose to solve problems in a professional environment - but that is also something that makes these crates interesting in a way.

Anyways, hope you found this interesting too :)
