A question about &str and String, and their conversion
Hello \~ Everyone\~

I am new to the rust programing language and I have a question when reading "The Book"

in this page : [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html)

in brief, the example source code is :

Why does the compiler automatically add "\[..\]"  ?  

Thanks in advance \~\~\~
