What application can I build with rust.
I have been learning the rust language for a while now using the Rust book. I understand that rust is so perfomant in building application backends, servers, embedded systems. How can I go about building web application backend using rust? Are there any framework for web apps in rust or I'll have to write everything from scratch?
