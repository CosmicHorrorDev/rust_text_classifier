Understanding rust variable reassignment.
Hello, fellow Rusteceans. I am a newbie to rust. I don't really understand how variable reassignment works yet.

So my question is this let's say I have a variable

let x = 2;

I can't assign another value to x 

x = 3;

that is not possible, but I can do this

let x = 3;

and the above works fine. So if I wanna use the x variable with the value of 2

let y = x;

what does the above x refer to? Is it the let x = 2 or let x = 3 and why. Thanks.
