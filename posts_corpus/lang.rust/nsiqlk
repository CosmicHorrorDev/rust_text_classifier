Thruster 1.1.2 Release - An express-like HTTP server in Rust
Hello all, it's been quite a while! For the last year or so, I've been dogfooding and making small tweaks to [Thruster](https://github.com/thruster-rs/Thruster) and I've finally released [a pretty significant milestone](https://github.com/thruster-rs/Thruster/blob/master/RELEASE.md).

Some highlights are:
- Totally rebuilt route tree and parser
- Totally rebuilt internal "middleware" system takes your list of middleware functions and combines them using closures
- Easier to use middleware macro
- Upgraded dependencies (yay!)

Some fun metrics from using Thruster in production:
- Over the past four months, it's handled 2.4 million requests
- Instances have 0% framework related fatal errors
- Average response time is well under 25ms for the 95th percentile
- Average RAM used per instance is 14.75MB

Please enjoy! Also, if anyone is looking to get involved, I'd love a hand in updating our benchmarks on TechEmpower.
