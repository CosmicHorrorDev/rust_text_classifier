Oh hell yeah, its kinda stupid, having 250 rounds to fire with long range high damage and very little to no recoil is just plain dumb, can the M249 do all of this? Yeah but....cmon man, anyways, motorbikes\n\nCheap to produce, cheap to maintain and cheap in fuel usage, aswell as being fast but restricts all the storage and protection of vehicles, i suppose adding a sidecar could give you a little storage and an extra passenger and with my previous suggestion possibly a machinegun usable by your passenger ww2 mg42 on sidecar style, or if your a loner be able to single hand fire pistols and some submachineguns from it, \nI dont actually have anymore suggestions currently but, discuss this with others or with me and ask whatever questions despite this never gonna be added probably"
