    "selftext": " The past 2 weeks I got back into Rust I had mild freezing problems. Since yesterday, however, I have been getting blue screens whenever I play this game. It does not happen with any other game except Rust. I can go about an hour or so without crashing. Sometimes Rust will freeze and I can hear my discord calls fine but the game freezes for a solid minute and when everything gets back to normal I am disconnected from the server. This is quite annoying as I have lost numerous fights because of this.. \n\n[Blue Screen Message](https://imgur.com/a/6mTHxsB)"
