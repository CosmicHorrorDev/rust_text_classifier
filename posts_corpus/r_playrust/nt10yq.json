I have played before and, while I am not great, I do know the game (less so since the underground mines/terror update a few months ago). I can't commit seriously but I really dislike playing alone and I love mining stones and the barrels along the road. Does anyone want an ally who will only commit to a few hours like right now and will mine for them? I don't need access to anyone's base. Just tell me the server name and bag me in somewhere close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also, why are there pools???"
