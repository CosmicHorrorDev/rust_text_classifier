    "selftext": "I really know little to nothing about creating modded servers, and I might try my hand at it, but if someone who is more skilled at it would like to pick up this idea, I\u2019m throwing it out there because it\u2019s a server I would like to see, and would be happy for someone to \u201csteal\u201d this idea. \n\nI recently started watching the MadMax films (so far seen the first three) out of appreciation of the aesthetic that Rust obviously was partly inspired by. I love them, if you haven\u2019t seen them you\u2019ll probably enjoy them as a Rust player. \n\nThe whole time I\u2019ve been watching them I\u2019ve been thinking how fun it would be to have a server with a really large desert map and long roads with monuments few and far in between and where car parts and low grade (\u201cthe juice\u201d) are vital parts of surviving.\n\nI would love to see car chases and battles, and moreover cars become more central to the game play on this server. I think having HVs be fairly common would make these kinds of battles possible on this server since cars otherwise are fairly difficult to bring down. \n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR: A MadMax server would be dope."
