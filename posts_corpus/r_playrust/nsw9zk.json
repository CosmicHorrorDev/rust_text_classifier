    "selftext": "I'm not really good at rust. I've been platinum In siege, DMG in csgo, diamond in valorant and even my rust pvp skills arent bad. Somehow, I seem to always run into such pro fucking groups of people all the time. I cant play at all hours of the day, many people who I reahced out to play with me stopped playing cause I cant give as much time in the game, for I have college and shit. So I ended up solo or occasionally a duo. Is there some kind of help I can get, I've lost so many guns now, so much gear to two 5 man groups that live nearby. I just wanted to vent I think, that's it. I'm not sure what I'm really looking for, just sad that I have lost many gunfights in two days time I guess that's it. \nAlso, anyone here playing in sea servers who wanna join me in some 2x 3x severs?"
