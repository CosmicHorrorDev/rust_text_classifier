It will freeze the game for a tiny second and then it will just continue running fine.  \nThese stutters last for about half a second and i've timed them to happen around every minute (only when running around or looking). \n\nI'm sure it's something new and i have not had this issue before.\n\nIt's not the garbage collecter issue, since i can actually see the GC(!) when that happens. This is something different.\n\nThe build is quite new (around 3 months old) i designed the set up and outsourced it to a tech store.\n\nI've already checked the temps, i've reinstalled the game and checked the integrity of the files. I did Windows mem diagnostic (no issues) and i even cleaned it out (not that there was much dust after only a few weeks). I basicly did everything that google presented me with..\n\nOh, and i don't notice this issue when im playing let's say APEX. So i'm getting really frustrated. \n\n  \nI hope anyone else has any idea what this might be. \n\nThanks in advance!"
