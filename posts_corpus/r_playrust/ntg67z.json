I can't seem to find an explanation. \n\nWhen I bought the Punk Rock pants I expected them to look like the 2nd picture and instead it looked like the one in the first. It's not just the colors, the 2nd one is also more worn out at the bottom which is a clear indicator that they are indeed different versions. \n\nPlease help me.\n\n \n\n[Ugly one](https://preview.redd.it/l5yela7kjl371.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d0bb407fbff5877019677d77015110afbfd181)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Good one](https://preview.redd.it/lqj1i0kmjl371.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=849b16b08bfcea57a90920bc3e14d546be327cfb)"
