    "selftext": "Just like my last and most recent suggestion post I know that the devs won't see this but im writing it anyways because I'm bored\n\nAh, melee combat, somthing you experience for a few short minutes smashing a guys face in with a rock or be the guy whose face is getting smashed in, we've all been there, you probably thought how you should of won that fight right, well from a realistic standpoint yeah, you could of, so I'm gonna go on a small rant about melee combat and...dumb shit (not really im just gonna explain my idea)\n\nSo back in dev blog....I forgot, Gary or one of the staff team mentioned expanding upon melee combat, adding parry, two handed weapons, etc, \n\nLight and heavy attacks, already we can perform standard attacks by pressing left mouse, to perform a heavy attack one woud hold said left mouse to charge up your melee weapon,charging your melee weapon adds a bit more damage to your swing or stab but obviously, your standing there not swinging\neasy and explainable \n\nParrys, here's somthing a bit more complex, to parry one must swing there weapon agasint someone who just charged a heavy attack and swung, hitting the opponents weapons out of the way and minorly injuring the opponent, that should make heavy attacks useless right, well...yeah....look I just thought this off the top of my head please don't yell at me\n\nBlocking; to block a attack one must hold im gonna say the scroll wheel but, im unsure, blocking will minimize damage from another melee weapon, heavy attacks and two handed weapons will ignore blocking and deal full damage \n\nShields: of course with all this i must include shields, usable in rhe opposite hand when using one handed melee weapons, yes there will be tiers of shields, shields will outright block damage from one handed melee weapons and decrease tve damage taken from two handed weapons and heavy attacks, though for balance having a shield equipped will decrease your attack speed by a smidgen therefor making it more difficult to parry forcing you to rely on the shield not breaking, of course the shield will also protect you from arrows, Eoka pistols (at a higher tier and when shot at the shield and not the legs or related) nail gun nails and harpoons if there added aswell as thrown weapons, of course the shield as mentioned as durability, \n\ns swing speed, lighter weapons like the bone club, bone knife etc, will swing the fastest but in return have a lower overall damage while the sword cleaver etc, are medium weapons and therefore a jack of all trades boasting medium damage and medium swing speed and heavy weapons, you get it, slow as a rock (literally and metaphorically)\n\nTwo handed weapons: two handed melee weapons will do the maximum amount of damage out 9f all 4 categorys, of weapons and swing the slowest, eatch variation effecting the swing speed of course, two handers also have a slightly higher block damage reduction than one handers but still transfer damage from all sources, \n\nExtra melee weapons: of course this all means there should be more melee weapons,, like a sledgehammer that can spawn throughout the world or a stone sledgehammer which is just a primitive recreation of a sledge hammer or, a buzz saw blade attached to a walking cane fallout style, or, the actual planet destroyer weapon,  a weapon wielded by gods but still struggle to wield the power, the Nokia on a stck"
