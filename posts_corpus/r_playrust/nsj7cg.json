    "selftext": "Like the title says how do I make myself less of a target for raids? I\u2019ve built on all different parts of the map, made my base as fortified as I can (stone with metal doors), and tried avoiding conflict with large teams as much as possible but I always find my base being raided by people with rockets and explosive ammo within 2-3 days. I\u2019m pretty new to the  game so any tips are appreciated."
