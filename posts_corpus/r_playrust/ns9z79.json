    "selftext": "For the past two ish months my brothers rust will crash after he plays for 5 minutes. No warning or problem notification after, just crashes. He has a good pc he built around a year ago, and hes tried verifying files, redownloading ect. Hes been able to play it fine before this. He plays arc and other hard to run games and they run fine aswell. Anyone know anything thats up? Hes also tried watching task manager when rust is open and nothing looks weird before crashes. Thanks."
