    "selftext": "This post serves as a warning to all players who might consider playing on VortexRust servers. While I have enjoyed the servers in the past the admins are struggling to manage things and entire wipes are being erased. Over the last three weeks 6 servers have been wiped completely or rolled back an hour+. While I think we can all understand that things happen the way the staff is handling it is another thing entirely. After wipes happen or rollbacks happen an admin will mute the game servers and begin removing comments in discord about the server issues. \n\nLet this be a warning, do not spend your time on their server until their uptime improves. \n\nFor stats around this please view the following link to measure server time - [https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/rust/4519748/downtime](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/rust/4519748/downtime). I believe the 100% uptime bars are broken across servers as BattleMetrics has logged numerous outages."
