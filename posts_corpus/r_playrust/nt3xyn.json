My calculator features all the type of smelters within one calculator - no multiple pages to have up.\n\nHope you enjoy this one as well as the Raid Calculator I've features earlier. Hope anybody will find it useful!\n\nLink: [https://rusttips.com/rust-smelter-calculator/](https://rusttips.com/rust-smelter-calculator/)\n\nHappy Eoka other nakeds!"
