    "selftext": "So, I've been playing rust for quite some time now on Xbox, but I have a small issue..\n\nI'm looking for a server with the least ping possible, since I'm not living in any of the server regions, and the PING number isn't showing at all. Most of the servers I've tried joining have lots of ping on my side\n\nIs there any way to fix that? It's just showing \"-\""
