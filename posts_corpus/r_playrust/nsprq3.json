    "selftext": "Morning rust players!\nSo I\u2019m new to the game. My first 2 weeks on the console on a monthly wipe sever. Me and 2 friends. Decent base, not been touched, crates filled with guns, metal armour. We feel like we\u2019re pretty solid for the next 2 weeks till wipe. Which makes me think is monthly too long? Like since it\u2019s console as well, there isn\u2019t much else to do other than raid bases with not that much to gain from them since they\u2019re mostly lower tier. Also, I realised with weekly wipes the map changes every wipe, so more frequent challenge on that aspect.\n\nJust thought I\u2019d get some opinions on this from some experienced rust players since I\u2019m only 2 weeks old for this game. Weekly or monthly and why?\n\nThank you in advance!"
