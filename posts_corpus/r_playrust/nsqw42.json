    "selftext": "70 days ago, I made the following post regarding the abysmal drop rates of Steam Skins:\n\n[Steam Skin Drops Should Be Overhauled](https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/mhy1gz/steam_skin_drops_should_be_overhauled/)\n\nAside from advocating for an overhaul to Steam skin drops, one of the major points of the post was detailing how little information we have regarding the drop rates of Rust skins. In that post, I suggested that if the rumor of a 70 day cool down was correct, I should expect to receive my next Steam skin on June 5th.\n\nInstead, I received my skin when I logged on to play on June 3rd within a minute of booting up the game. I was waiting for the server lobby to finish loading servers when I got the notification that I had a new item in my inventory (1 Cloth. Yay...)\n\nNow, I can't say for certain what the cool down is as last month was a bust for my Rust experience and I stopped playing early in the month to take care of some other stuff, but 68 days seems unlikely. 60 days sounds like a much more reasonable, round number.\n\nIf Facepunch won't supply the information on the drop rates of the Steam skins, perhaps we as a community can work together to figure this out ourselves.\n\nTo recap: The prevailing theory is that currently you need to put a certain number of hours into the game, likely around 24, and you can only receive 1 skin every X days. If there's anyone else that has been keeping close tabs on their Steam skin drops, we may be able to use that info to form a pattern. Right now there's wildly conflicting info."
