    "selftext": "The storage monitor only works with large storage and tool cupboard which isn\u2019t as useful as it can be, it would work tremendously better if it could connect to the Shop Front, or the DropBox.Another thing that could be improved is if the Storage Monitor could be sent to pulse only if a requested item is found in the storage, or a particular amount.The creative aspect of this would be tremendous, it would add infinitely to the electricity system and would allow for a lot of things to be made.For example, rental housing, rentable car lifts, rentable workbenches. Puzzles. Puzzles that could involve putting certain items in different storage containers to open a door. You could make a rust escape room, and charge people to get in via this type of component. Certain puzzles might require a certain item to be dispensed through a dropbox to progress through the escape room. \n\nThere could be a room with a tier 3 workbench in it, and it costs 15 scrap (into a dropbox or shopfront connected to a storage monitor) to send a pulse to a garage door to close that would prevent a hostile turret for firing for a minute or two.\n\nA work around at least could be a component that transfers items from one type of container to another, so from Shop Front to Large Storage, then the Storage Monitor could do its work."
