    "selftext": "So I just got the game and I had  a few questions about the tech trees. I know there there are 3 trees, do you have to have the respective workbench to get the tree or does the 2nd tree have the first one and the 3rd have the 2nd? Also, if you unlock everything in the tier 1 workbench, and then you deconstruct it, can you still craft all of the things in tier 1? Also, when you need to craft certain things, they have a workbench level requirement. Lets say that I want to craft something that requires level 1, but I only have a level 2 workbench, can I still craft the item?"
