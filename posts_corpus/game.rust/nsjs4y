Got banned from reddit servers because they thought I was cheating
Hi everyone, I'm alberust and I'm here to show everyone that I'm legit since I got banned for "cheating" on reddit servers. I've been playing Rust for 4/5 years (over 10k hours total). Since last year, I've been "harassed" by the community and devs, having multiple accounts banned for completly no reason.

Here some clips of me playing and enjoying the last of the April wipe.
