If you see another boat, always check boat storage and fuel.
Even if it is a boat on shore, take a look at the storage.  
Yesterday I found a DB with every kind of ammo for it inside a boat storage near Bandits. Clearly, someone came there to recycle and left it behind. As a primitive, that was jackpot.  


Then I found someone who did a rig or cargo left their RHIB behind with a huge stack of comps + low grade fuel in their boat storage. I was like " Ka-ching " and yoinked it. Easily 500 scrap from recycling all that.   


As a new player who suck at PvP, plays solo and use boats to do monuments and recycling runs, this was a seriously good way to get loot in between any runs. I'm also thinking of setting up an RF receiver to scav after people do rigs. I find boats on rigs often have loot stored in that was left behind by people who had either too many boats or just rage quitted after getting killed by scientists.
