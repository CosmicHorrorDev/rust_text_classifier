Game Suspension for Rust
Hello, so I recently got a "Game Suspension" for 3 days apparently because I was "repeatedly being disruptive to other players in-game" I don't know if it was a coincidence or not but it happened about 5 minutes after I bodied these 2 kids over and over as I was rading a base and they kept trying to come back and counter. I was wonering if theres anyway I could get this suspension lifted as I have done nothing wrong, would I need to contact steam or something?
