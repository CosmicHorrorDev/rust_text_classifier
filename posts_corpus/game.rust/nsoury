Oceania servers not working on Xbox one
I am an Xbox one player just got rust, live in Western Australia and cannot access Oceania servers only Asia, Europe, and American. I’m pretty confused cause I think Oceania servers are Australia’s main servers but yeah anyone else having this problem or know how to fix it cheers.
