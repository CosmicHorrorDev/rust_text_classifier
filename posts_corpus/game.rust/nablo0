Looking for Rust Players who Love Skins!
https://discord.gg/tWtCaQdmnM  
  
Our discord is accepting new members and we would love to have you around!  
We are skin enthusiasts. If you don't want to trade/buy/sell skins, just come join to see all the latest info about their releases and engage with our really chill community. :)  
We flip skins to make money and discuss the rise and fall of existing skin prices.  
Every week when the Weekly Rust Skin Shop updates with fresh new skins, you'll be the first to know what they are and the first to know what will make you profit.  
We keep our members up to date on all the latest Rust news/updates by sharing Shadowfrax, MisterFlak, and TGG videos the minute they release.  
Want even more flavor?
