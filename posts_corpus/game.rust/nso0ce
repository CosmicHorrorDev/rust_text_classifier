Potential server crash fix
Could be coincidental but this is what I did and got into a server first try. 

I’m on a Xbox one x btw

(If possible make sure Xbox is the only thing on that specific WiFi connection.)

2. Deleted rust from my console and reinstalled both the beta and the full game. 

3. Opened the beta application and let it load in completely to main screen I even checked the “stats” page to see if it had any.

4. Closed beta and opened rust

I got in to the first server I joined

Again could be coincidental but I haven’t been able get into a server for over a day now and basically tried everything lol.
Sorry if it doesn’t work
pog if it does 
Good luck
