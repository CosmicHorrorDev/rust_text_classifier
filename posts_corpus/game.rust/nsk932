Walls disappearing?
We have high external wood walls around our base, which are fine. They haven’t moved. But we have stone walls with a door in between the 2 to get in the base, and it keeps disappearing. The TC is in range, and we even added another outside to test and it keeps disappearing. This is the 4th time we’ve built it, and I couldn’t imagine someone spending so much time to blow it up but not even touch our actual base. Anyone else had this experience?
