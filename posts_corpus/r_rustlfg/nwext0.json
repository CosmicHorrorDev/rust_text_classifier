    "selftext": "\nMy clan is looking for chill/ mature/adultish players to make a server wide safe zone, similar to how the bandit camp works. We are working to establish shops, safety ,and a sense of community for newer players in hopes it will raise the server population. So far we are \u201cThe Straw Hats\u201d a clan of 5 players looking to add 3 more next wipe. We also have 2 other brother clans working with us to achieve this goal. Im sure we all know how this game can make you hate existence as an entirety, so why not make some sort of community that has each other\u2019s back. \n\n\nAdd IcarusTheYungTTV on PSN"
