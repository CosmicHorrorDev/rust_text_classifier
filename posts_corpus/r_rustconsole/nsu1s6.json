    "selftext": "If you're a solo player in this game you probably know how hard it is to advance or maybe even make it to endgame (especially if you're of a mature age and have daily responsibilities and can only play a few hours each night after work). There's also fps and technical issues that tip the game against solo players. Watch this video for reference https://youtu.be/np0pNx6X2kM .\n\nUntil community servers go live in order to balance things a little better solo players will always play at a disadvantage on official servers.\n\nWhich is why I propose we start solo-player only (proximity/game chat only) zerg events (even as flawed as proximity/chat currently is in the game). Where we meet up on a specific server each event in order to take out the toxic clans/zerg that KOS nakeds or lower specd players and only communicate through party chat.\n\nJust a thought."
