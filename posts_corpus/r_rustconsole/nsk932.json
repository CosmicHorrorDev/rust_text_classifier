    "selftext": "We have high external wood walls around our base, which are fine. They haven\u2019t moved. But we have stone walls with a door in between the 2 to get in the base, and it keeps disappearing. The TC is in range, and we even added another outside to test and it keeps disappearing. This is the 4th time we\u2019ve built it, and I couldn\u2019t imagine someone spending so much time to blow it up but not even touch our actual base. Anyone else had this experience?"
