    "selftext": "Hello rust players!\nI\u2019m about 2 weeks into a monthly server with 2 weeks left to go and I feel like we\u2019ve hit a point of not that much to do other than offline raid people since the pop is pretty low at the minute, got chests full of guns armour and stuff. So I was thinking would weekly wipe servers be better for this problem? Also the frequent map change that happens on weekly servers rather than waiting a full month for a map change.\n\nJust wanted to know more experienced players opinions on this since the console is my first time playing rust."
