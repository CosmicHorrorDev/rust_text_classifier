Deleted rust from my console and reinstalled both the beta and the full game. \n\n3. Opened the beta application and let it load in completely to main screen I even checked the \u201cstats\u201d page to see if it had any.\n\n4. Closed beta and opened rust\n\nI got in to the first server I joined\n\nAgain could be coincidental but I haven\u2019t been able get into a server for over a day now and basically tried everything lol.\nSorry if it doesn\u2019t work\npog if it does \nGood luck"
