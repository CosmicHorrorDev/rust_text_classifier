However tonight by resetting all my graphics in game my character/avatar is now on the inventory screen. With more playing on the in game graphics I discovered that by turning off the motion blur this would cause the character/avatar to slowing disappear as the items put on were not visible or just cause the character in whole to disappear. No other graphics settings seemed to cause an issue to the character/avatar display."
