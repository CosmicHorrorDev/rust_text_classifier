    "selftext": "My issue is the fact that after the very 1st update or maintenance for this game you could no longer jump up rocks or climb ladders. Before the update you were able to jump ontop of some bigger rocks that stand pretty tall. Now you can't do that you can barley stand on the rocks without sliding down. Is this getting fixed? I know the ladders got fixed today but what about the rocks? Is this supposed to happen or is this an actual bug? (And yes I know you can use ladders but only a limited amount)"
