I want to switch servers to an OC server, but every single fucking time I get to \"Terrain Textures\" the game fucking crashes and gives me a pop-up saying \n\n\"An error has occurred in the following application:\n(CE-34878-0)\nRust\"\n\nI clicked on \"suggested actions\" and did everything it told me to and this fucking bullshit keeps happening.\n\nI paid seventy fucking dollars for this, i should be able to play a game where I'm not lagging like crazy because the only servers I can play in have 350+ ping.\n\nSorry for the language but I'm getting very frustrated. I've been trying fixes for over TWO FUCKING HOURS, ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES AND I STILL CANT EVEN PLAY THIS FUCKING BULLSHIT"
