    "selftext": "They shouldn\u2019t have even thought about releasing this game for another 6 months. How do they not see what happens to games that are shit and released underdeveloped. After 3 weeks of misery playing this game I doubt our group will ever play this game again and if we do it probably won\u2019t be until a year from now. I\u2019m guessing a good chunk of the player base has the same idea We do. None of this makes sense... from everything to bugs, glitches, crashing, lag, and unbalanced game mechanics. I don\u2019t know who could look at this dumpster fire of a game and give it the green light to be released."
