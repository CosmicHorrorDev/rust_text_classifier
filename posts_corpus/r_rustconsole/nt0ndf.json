    "selftext": "I\u2019ve logged on since they\u2019ve made their update and I\u2019ve crashed at least 5 times. The stuttering is lasting longer than 3 seconds. It\u2019s completely unplayable. \n\nI\u2019ve exited my base with full gear and supplies - crash. Log back on to all my stuff looted.\n\nIn PvP battle - 13 second stutter. Resume gameplay, dead. \n\nLooking in a chest in base w/ a friend - crash. \n\nPrior to this update, the game wasn\u2019t great. There was stuttering here and there but you could still manage to play and enjoy the game. Since the update, the game is completely unplayable for me and just absolutely terrible."
