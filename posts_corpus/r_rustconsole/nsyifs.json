They haven\u2019t said anything about it happening on Ps4 only Xbox. Seriously this games so bugged out. I understand but why release it if it\u2019s almost unplayable? Like some days you literally cannot play at all cause you can\u2019t join a single server. People are gonna loose bases cause of this shit. What a way to make first time players never wanna touch the game again. Rust has been out for as long as I can remember so surely it couldn\u2019t be that hard to make it on console and if it is DONT RELEASE IT UNTIL ITS PLAYABLE"
