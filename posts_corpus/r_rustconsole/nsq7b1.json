    "selftext": "This game is terrible now. I'm running on 10 fps after the patch on an xbox one x and I crash every 5 mins, i was in a gunfight and froze for 10 seconds and lost all my shit. This patch fixes nothing and it made it 100 percent worse. Fu k this game. I called in a supply drop only to be kicked out of the game and once i spawned back in i crashed again. My shit go robbed."
