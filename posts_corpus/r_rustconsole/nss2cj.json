    "selftext": "So, it seems that the general consensus on zergs in rust is that they are scummy people and, with the amount of them on each server, it is making life incredibly difficult for solos/duos etc and a lot of people are calling for community servers.\n\nHowever, I have played Ark/Conan Exiles in the past and I posted on Reddit about offline raiding and the ability of large groups to just curbstomp solos online and offline, but no one ever seemed to have a problem with that on those games. When I posted about this and asked for solo servers etc, the general consensus was \u2018get good noob\u2019 or basically telling me not to fight, have several mini bases etc etc, and telling me if I didn\u2019t like it then to uninstall. These posts were actually considerably downvoted.\n\nMy question is, why tf is rust seemingly the only survival game in which people actually dislike zergs?\n\nTL;DR - Rust is the only survival game I\u2019ve played where general consensus is that zergs are bad, on conan and ark ppl just tell you to get gud if you complain, why?"
