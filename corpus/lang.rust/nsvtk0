Your dev environment
So I've been using rust for about a year now, and wouldn't call myself anything close to an expert, but it's my goto language of choice for most things now.

I was curious to know what others are using for their dev environments. 

I'm currently switching between a Win10 laptop (ssh'd to a linux server) and a iMacPro using intellij, but was thinking of going for a 100% linux laptop... for a better bang for buck, and being able to code anywhere

so.. I was wondering what other people use to do development on.. 

most of my dev is react for the front end UI & rust for the back  (and rust for smart contracts).. 

Thanks in advance.
