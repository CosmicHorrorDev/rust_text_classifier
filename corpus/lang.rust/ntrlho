5 years later, open sourcing the PlayRustClassifier
Recently [it was requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/nrr3k3/can_we_get_a_pinned_post_about_the_game/h0idouo/?context=8&depth=9) that I open source the code behind the PlayRustClassifier, a project that /u/pegasos1 and I built for our RustConf 2016 talk - my first conference talk and an overall incredible experience.

We wanted to evaluate Rust for machine learning/ data science, so we built a fairly simplistic binary classifier to determine if a post was actually about rust-the-video-game or rust-the-programming-language. I refuse to watch myself give a talk, but as I recall it actually ended up being pretty accurate - not too surprising given the features that we extracted (ie: presence of a Rust keyword was a considerable weight).

Looking back on the code it's sort of hilarious to think of how far Rust has come. First of all, it doesn't compile (and it seems to reference a dependency by path that I've now lost? mighta been vendored and patched, I seem to recall some panics in ML libs back then), and I forgot that even back then I had to use things like \`#!\[feature(custom\_derive, plugin)\]\` just to work with json. Nightly rust and constantly breaking dependencies was just the way things were.

Our Rust skills back in 2016 were also... not as evolved. It was also written in free time, while also preparing for the conference talk - basically, it's not great.

PRs are welcome, although frankly I just recommend you fork it - I'm happy to rubber stamp PRs but I rarely check my personal github these days. I actually don't have my git SSH key on my main laptop otherwise I would have already cleaned up a ton. If anyone is interested, I quickly wrote up an issue on Github with some of the obvious first steps to fixing this code up.
