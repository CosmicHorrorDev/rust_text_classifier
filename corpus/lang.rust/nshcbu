How Long Should It Take A Beginner To Learn Rust and Build Projects?
A week ago I decided to learn Rust. My goal is to build a web app using Rust/WASM. I have some experience with JavaScript and Python. I'm quickly realizing that low-level languages are hard!  


I'm halfway through *The Rust Programming Language* by Steve Klabnik. Today I was a bit frustrated while trying to work on my project. I think this frustration is a sign that I'm rushing the learning process and that I need a realistic timeline.  


I know most of you here are more experienced / knowledgeable than myself. When you started programming or learning Rust, when did you feel ready to build projects? Months? Years? I'm devoting at least 6 hours a day to honing this skill. Any other wisdom and advice is much appreciated! Cheers.
