Rust and C++ Unit testing with cxx
Hello all,

I am currently working on a new repository where we have cxx setup with cargo build and I am wondering what the best way to run C++ unit tests would be (ideally from `cargo test`). We are flexible on what testing framework is used.

Rust tests are easy enough and testing of anything which is `extern "C++"` is just an extension of the Rust test framework, but specifically I am trying to figure out how to write C++ tests for C++ code and possibly for `extern "Rust"` integrations in C++ land.
