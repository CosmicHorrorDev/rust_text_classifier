Rust from a JavaScript perspective - A tongue in cheek walk-through
I am a beginner in Rust, and I've really come to enjoy the language. I still have a metric TON of things to learn - both in depth and at large - but I thought I'd document, in a mildly funny way, my current understanding for fellow fence-sitters; especially those (like me) from a JavaScript back-ground (and if you are a React person, you might like [this lib](https://github.com/kapolos/react-godfather/) btw).

Have fun, I certainly did while writing it :)
