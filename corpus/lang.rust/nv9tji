Darkroom: A VCR contract testing tool built in Rust
Over the last year and a half I've been developing an integration testing tool called [Darkroom](https://github.com/mkatychev/darkroom) accompanied by the DSL spec [filmReel](https://github.com/mkatychev/filmreel)

Until the `argh` crate [bumps their version](https://github.com/google/argh/issues/89) I cannot updater the version on crates.io so the install command currently is:
`
cargo install --git https://github.com/mkatychev/darkroom
`


The [examples](https://github.com/mkatychev/darkroom#examples) in the README should make it somewhat clear in how it works, these use the Stripe test API and httpbin.

`dark man [command]` features documentation built into the CLI tool.

Here are some nice features Iâ€™ve added over the development cycle:
- HTTP support
- gRPC support (assuming `grpcurl` is installed)
- [retry attempts](https://github.com/mkatychev/filmreel/blob/master/extra_concepts/retry_attempts.md)
- [secrets handling](https://github.com/Bestowinc/filmReel/blob/master/extra_concepts/hidden_variables.md) (still has edge case issues on response diff)
- [partial comparison](https://github.com/mkatychev/filmreel/blob/master/extra_concepts/validation.md)
- unordered comparisons
- arbitrary reordering of the test flow called[ "virtual reels"](https://github.com/mkatychev/darkroom/blob/master/test_data/post.vr.json)


repo that demonstrates how partial and unordered comparison works [here](https://github.com/mkatychev/darkroom_httpbin) (needs go installed)
