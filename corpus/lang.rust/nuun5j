Looking for devs.
Reposting this inquiry with full context/structure. 

I’m in the process of raising funds for a blockchain-based social media dApp on the Solana protocol. Decentralized social media applications are an underserved focus of crypto & centralized big tech doesn’t always keep the best interests of the user in mind. This project seeks to solve this problem. 

1. Solana blockchain’s main language is Rust. I’m looking for a dev(s) who preferably have experience with creating either social media platforms, or blockchain-based applications.
2. The hosting firm is a NY-based startup. East coast devs are preferred, but not required. 
3. Hours will be as you wish, but the timeline for the first working prototype is 3-5 weeks.
4. Commission/pay is negotiable. Given this is a start-up, we’re looking to commission a first draft of the project before bringing on full-time employees once funding is secured. Also subject to project revenue.

As mentioned, we are in the fundraising process. Design templates, logos, functional operations of the platform, etc. has all been outlined. Far from just an “idea”. Please respond or DM with your experience.
