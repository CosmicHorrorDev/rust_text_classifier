Is anyone else having problems with the game constantly crashing?
My game keeps crashing at random times and it isn’t just my Xbox, it’s happened to me and my friends on every server we’ve played on and it just started happening after today’s update. I’m on an older Xbox but that isn’t the problem since all of my other friends are on the Series X/S. Has anyone found out anything about this or experienced this issue?
