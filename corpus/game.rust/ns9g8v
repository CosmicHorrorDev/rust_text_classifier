**The issue;**

Hi everyone,

Recently i've noticed these mini lag spikes / stutters while playing rust and seeing the FPS drop from 100/140 to around 70/80. It will freeze the game for a tiny second and then it will just continue running fine.  
These stutters last for about half a second and i've timed them to happen around every minute (only when running around or looking). 

I'm sure it's something new and i have not had this issue before.

It's not the garbage collecter issue, since i can actually see the GC(!) when that happens. This is something different.

The build is quite new (around 3 months old) i designed the set up and outsourced it to a tech store.

I've already checked the temps, i've reinstalled the game and checked the integrity of the files. I did Windows mem diagnostic (no issues) and i even cleaned it out (not that there was much dust after only a few weeks). I basicly did everything that google presented me with..

Oh, and i don't notice this issue when im playing let's say APEX. So i'm getting really frustrated. 

  
I hope anyone else has any idea what this might be. 

Thanks in advance!
